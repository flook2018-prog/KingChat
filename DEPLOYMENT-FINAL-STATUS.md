### 🎯 **Root Cause:**
Railway domain routing issue - server is running but proxy not forwarding requests correctly.

### 🔧 **Solution:**
The server is working! The issue is Railway's domain proxy. Try:

1. **Wait 10-15 minutes** for Railway DNS propagation
2. **Clear browser cache** and try again
3. **Use incognito mode** to avoid cached 404
4. **Try direct Railway URL** from Railway dashboard
